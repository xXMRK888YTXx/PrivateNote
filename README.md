# Project description
PrivateNote is an application with the functions of notes and to-do list, but its functionality is not limited to this.

The main functionality of the application:

* Create notes and encrypt them using a strong AES encryption algorithm.

* Store images and audio in your notes, which are as securely encrypted as the note's contents.

* Create categories, and color labels for them.

* Add notes to favorites.

* Create your own to-do list.

* Send yourself a reminder so you don't forget anything.

* Protect the app with a password or biometrics.

* Create backups so you don't lose your data. Copies can be saved both locally and on Google Drive.
